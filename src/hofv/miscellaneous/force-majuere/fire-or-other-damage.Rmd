###  [Fire or Other Damage to Village]{.underline}. If the Village is damaged by fire, earthquake, act of God, the elements or other casualty or is condemned by an authority exercising the powers of eminent domain or the Village is transferred in lieu of the exercise of such power so as to render the Village unusable for its intended purpose at any time during the Term, then HOFV shall have the option, but not the obligation, to repair the damage or loss. HOFV shall notify Sponsor as to whether HOFV shall effect such repair and restoration within thirty (30) days after the casualty. If HOFV notifies Sponsor that HOFV is electing to effect such repairs and restoration, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect; provided, however, that the Term shall be extended by such number of days as equals the length of the period from the date of the event until such repairs and restoration are complete. If HOFV notifies Sponsor that HOFV is electing not to effect such repairs and restoration, then this Agreement and all rights granted hereunder shall terminate as of the date of such fire or other casualty, and HOFV shall refund to Sponsor any unused, prepaid Sponsorship Fees. {#miscellaneous:force-majuere:fire-or-other-damage}
