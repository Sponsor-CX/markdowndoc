\section{SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT}\label{sponsorship-agreement}}

This SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT (the ``\uline{Agreement}'') is made and
entered into as of {[}Date{]}, 2022 (the ``\uline{Effective Date}''), by
and among HOF Village Newco, LLC (``\uline{HOFV}''), and {[}Sponsor
Entity{]} (``\uline{Sponsor}''). HOFV and Sponsor may be referred to
collectively herein as the ``Parties'' and each individually as a
``Party''.

\hypertarget{witnesseth}{%
\subsection{WITNESSETH:}\label{witnesseth}}

\textbf{WHEREAS,} Sponsor desires to become a sponsor of the Hall of
Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls in Canton, Ohio (the
``Village'') and to obtain the rights set forth herein in connection
with such sponsorship;

\textbf{WHEREAS,} HOFV has the authority to enter into this Agreement
with Sponsor and is willing to do so for the consideration stated
herein.

\textbf{NOW, THEREFORE,} in consideration of the promises herein
contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\uline{Term}}. The term of this Agreement (the ``Term''),
  unless sooner terminated as provided herein, shall commence on the
  Effective Date and continue for a period of {[}\# of Year(s){]},
  expiring on {[}Exipration Date{]}.
\item
  \textbf{\uline{Fees}}. For the sponsorship and other rights described
  herein, Sponsor shall pay to HOFV fees (the ``Fees'') in the amounts,
  on the dates and in the manner set forth on Exhibit A, in addition to
  any other amounts and details required by the terms of this Agreement.
  In the event, and during the period in which the Agreement is valid
  and in force, any amounts confirmed owed by the Sponsor, in which the
  Sponsor fails to pay pursuant to Section 2 and Section 4 will accrue
  interest from the due date at the annual rate of ten percent (10\%)
  per annum, or, if less, the highest rate permitted by applicable
  federal, state or local laws or regulations (collectively,
  ``Applicable Laws''). The Parties acknowledge and agree that payment
  of the Fees in full is a prerequisite to Sponsor receiving any of the
  Sponsorship Rights as set forth in Section 3.
\item
  \textbf{\uline{Sponsorship Rights}}. Subject to the terms of this
  Agreement, HOFV hereby grants to Sponsor, for the Term, the
  sponsorship rights, advertising rights and other benefits described on
  Exhibit B (the ``Sponsorship Rights'').
\item
  \textbf{\uline{Production and Execution of Sponsorship Rights}}.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Unless otherwise set forth in \uline{Exhibit B}, Sponsor shall be
    responsible for any expenses incurred in its exercise of the granted
    Sponsorship Rights, including, but not limited to, costs for any
    signage, physical presence at the Village, taxes and permit fees,
    and any travel expenses. To the extent HOFV is responsible for
    sourcing creation of advertising material for Sponsor, Sponsor shall
    be invoiced by HOFV for any such materials at the retail cost
    charged to HOFV by the supplier, without additional mark-up. Payment
    with respect to such invoice will be due forty-five (45) days
    following receipt by Sponsor of such invoice.
  \item
    The design, layout, content and copy of all advertising and/or
    promotional materials covered by this Agreement are subject to prior
    written approval by HOFV, which approval shall not be unreasonably
    withheld (provided, however, that a rejection or denial of approval
    shall not be considered unreasonable if HOFV, in its sole
    discretion, determines that an advertising or promotional material
    covered by this Agreement is used in any manner that is contrary to
    public morals, could be deceptive or misleading or could reflect
    unfavorably on the good name, goodwill, reputation or image of
    HOFV). Design, layout, content and copy for advertising and/or
    promotional materials covered by this Agreement may be changed at
    Sponsor's expense; provided, however, that such changes (including
    any change in the product to be advertised) must be approved in
    advance in writing by both HOFV and Sponsor.
  \item
    Sponsor agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to supply HOFV with
    camera-ready artwork required for the production of advertising
    and/or promotional materials at least thirty (30) days before such
    material is scheduled to be produced. Sponsor hereby specifically
    authorizes HOFV to use such artwork in the production of the
    advertising and/or promotional materials and represents and warrants
    that all of its advertising copy shall comply with all applicable
    federal, state and local laws pertinent to the advertising of its
    products.
  \item
    HOFV has the right to refrain from displaying or illuminating
    Sponsor's advertising panels when required to do so by agreements
    with the National Football League (``NFL''), any other professional
    sports league, or by television network commitments.
  \end{enumerate}

    and to the Marks, and all goodwill associated with or symbolized by
    the Marks. Subject to the license granted hereunder, each Party
    reserves all right, title and interest in and to its Marks and any
    merchandising rights in and to such Marks, and all goodwill
    associated with or symbolized by such Marks. Sponsor shall have no
    right to use the Marks of HOFV without the prior written consent of
    HOFV, which may be withheld in its sole discretion.

    nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty free license to use the marks
    set forth on \uline{Exhibit C} (``\uline{HOFV's Marks}'') in the
    United States during the Term in connection with, but only to the
    extent necessary to provide for, the Sponsorship Rights. All uses of
    HOFV's Marks shall inure solely to HOFV's benefit. On termination or
    expiration of this Agreement, Sponsor shall cease all use of HOFV's
    Marks as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30)
    days unless the particular media which has been approved requires a
    longer lead time, but in no event longer than ninety (90) days.
    Sponsor shall have no right to assign any right granted hereunder to
    use HOFV's Marks or any other Sponsorship Rights granted hereunder,
    to any third party or co-brand, or the HOFV's Marks in an express or
    implied connection or association with any third parties.

      marketed, distributed and sold in the relevant marketplaces.
    \item
      Sponsor shall comply with all Applicable Laws and shall obtain all
      necessary licenses, permits, and governmental approvals, in
      connection with the manufacture, promotion, advertising,
      distribution, and sale of the products and services utilizing
      HOFV's Marks.
    \item

      perform, do, or cause any act to be done, or fail to take any
      action, during or after the Term, or assist any third party in
      performing, doing, and/or causing any act to be done, which would
      in any way or manner be detrimental to, injure or impair, in any
      way or to any degree: (i) the HOFV's Marks; (ii) any applications
      for registration and/or registrations therefor; (iii) the goodwill
      related to the HOFV's Marks; (iv) HOFV's federal, state and/or
      common law and other rights in or to HOFV's Marks; (v) HOFV's
      right, title, interest, and ownership in and to HOFV's Marks;

      foregoing.

      HOFV's events and services and agrees that HOFV may use Sponsor's
      Marks provided that HOFV's events and services are of similar or
      better quality to the events and services that HOFV offers as of
      the Effective Date. On termination or expiration of this
      Agreement, HOFV shall cease all use of Sponsor's Marks as soon as
      practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days unless the
      particular media which has been approved requires a longer lead
      time, but in no event longer than ninety (90) days.
    \item
      HOFV acknowledges, understands, and agrees that it shall not
      perform, do, or cause any act to be done, or fail to take any
      action, during or after the Term, or assist any third party in

      that, if the default specified in such notice is curable but of a

    non-public information and/or trade secrets received rom the other
    party in the course of performing the obligations set forth in this
    Agreement that is either marked as ``Confidential'' or which, under
    the circumstances, ought to be treated as confidential
    (collectively, ``\textbf{Confidential Information}'') (except with
    respect to their owners, lenders and advisors, each of whom is to be
    made aware of and instructed to comply with this confidentiality
    provision) unless the proposed disclosure is authorized in advance
    by the other Party or is otherwise required by law. In the event
    that either Party or any of its representatives becomes legally
    compelled to disclose Confidential Information, such Party shall, to
    the extent reasonably practicable, provide the other Party with
    prompt written notice before such disclosure, sufficient to enable
    such other Party either to seek a protective order, at its expense,
    or another appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such
    disclosure or to waive compliance with the provisions of this
    \uline{Section 11.8}, or both. Notwithstanding the above,
    ``Confidential Information'' will not include any information that
    (a) is publicly available at the time of disclosure or subsequently
    becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party;
    (b) became known to the receiving party prior to the disclosing
    party's disclosure of such information to the receiving party; (c)

    disclosing party other than by breach of an obligation of
    confidentiality owed to the disclosing party; or (d) is
    independently developed by the receiving party.

    agree on the content of any press release prior to its publication.
  \item

    organization involved in events at the Village.

    convenience and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of
    the provisions set forth herein.
  \item
    \uline{Counterparts}. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
    counterparts, and on separate counterparts, each of which shall be
    deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute
    one and the same instrument. HOFV and Sponsor agree that electronic
    signatures are valid and effective, and that an electronically
    stored copy of this Agreement constitutes proof of the signature and
    contents of this Agreement, as though it were an original.
  \item
    \uline{Waiver}. Any failure by either Party to insist upon the
    performance of a provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a
    waiver of any other right of either Party which the Party may have
    under this Agreement. Any such waiver can only be made in writing
    signed by the Party against whom enforcement of such waiver is
    sought.
  \item
    \uline{Severability}. In the event that any provision of this
    Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason by a court
    of competent jurisdiction, such provision or part thereof shall be
    considered separate from the remaining provisions of this Agreement,
    which remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
    Such invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed revised to
    effect, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the intent of the
    Parties as set forth herein.
